Hello everyone and welcome to my first video blog. I'll be updating you every two weeks to present pertinent information about the real estate market in order for you to make more educated choices about buying, selling, or investing. I'm here to help you, and I appreciate you watching.

## What to Expect in the Kelowna Real Estate Market for 2014....
* **2013 proved to be a year of recovery for our market**, but it was part of a larger cycle of real estate.
  * boom time (which occurred from 2004-2008), slump (what we just experienced in 2008-2012), and then recovery, which began right around the fall of 2012. Each of these cycles take about 4 years.
* **What does our current recovery look like?** To start, **sales have increased 15% since last year**, and **sales were up 45% this December** compared to last December.
  * **Inventory has shrunk by about 15%**. This combination of high demand and low(er) supply will start to make home prices rise, but not like anything that we saw in 2007.
  * **Interest Rates:** Surprisingly, interest rates have dropped from **3.59% to 3.09%**. This will contribute to the buying temperature and also to a more stable, balanced market.
  * Inventory is at healthy 5 month supply, but don't expect multiple offers or high prices right now.
## My Predictions for 2014: The Same as 2013, but More Pronounced
* Inventory will continue to shrink.
* Sales will keep going up.
* Properties will appreciate anywhere from 2-5%, which would be the first time in 5 years that that has happened.
Overall I'm really confident about 2014. I think this will be a good year to own and invest in Kelowna real estate. Thanks again for watching my first video blog, but stay tuned because there will be much more to come!
