Most people associate the great weather, chirping birds, and shining sun of spring with a successful home sale. While it's true your home often looks fantastic during the spring season, it's not necessarily the best time to sell.

The problem with the spring selling season is **everyone is putting their homes on the market at that time.** This means you're competing with up to five other homeowners at a time, which could force you to price your home tens of thousands of dollars less than you would have otherwise.

In the fall and winter you certainly won't get as many showings, but the **showings you do get will be from highly qualified buyers.** These buyers are also serious about getting into a home because many of them are trying to get moved and settled before Christmas. Since there are qualified and serious buyers on the market and little competition among sellers, **the fall is an ideal time to try to get top dollar for your home.**

It's a simple supply and demand type situation. With fewer sellers and a pool of quality buyers, there is higher demand for your home, and that demand will ultimately help you get a higher price for your home. With the market still going strong here in Kelowna, there is **no better time to put your home on the market.**
