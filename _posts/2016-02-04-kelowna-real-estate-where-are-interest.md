**I received a question from a client about what might happen with interest rates this year.** This is a great question, and I think everyone needs to know the answer.
**I do believe that the prime rate will be relatively unaffected in 2016.** A lot of our Canadian growth is derived from the energy sector, which has been struggling lately.

**However, the banks will be slowly ratcheting up their mortgage interest rates.** You can expect to pay 3% on a 5-year loan. Many of the discounted rates that were available in the past are no longer being offered. **We've seen demand remain strong even with these slight increases.** I don't expect the lending rate to increase much further, because our economy relies on cheap borrowing.**

Ultimately, I see mortgage rates staying very close to where they are. **This will not affect your affordability very much. However, if you're buying, I recommend that you do so quite soon before rates increase any further.**

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you!
