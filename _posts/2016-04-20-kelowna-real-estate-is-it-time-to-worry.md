**We just came off a banner month in March, as our team completed 46 transactions!** We’re fairly exhausted but we know that we have even busier days ahead of us as we delve into the spring and summer markets. However, **I have some real estate stats to share with you as we move into the spring and summer.**

>  * Single family homes sales have risen by 21% in Q1 2016 to Q1 2015.
>  * Home values have increased by 9.5% from $521k to $571k.
>  * 514 condos have sold this year, which is a 21% increase from last year.
>  * Condos have appreciated in value by 7%.
>  * It’s taking 66 days to sell a house and 75 days to sell a condo.
>  * Inventory has fallen since last year, and we only have three months of inventory.

Another thing you should know is that homes that are priced well and in good condition are selling quickly and they’re usually getting more than one offer. **If you’re selling, this is your chance to have a quick and profitable sale!**

If you’re thinking about buying, we have a special search for listings that have not yet hit the market, or for homes that have been sitting on the market for a bit.

**In just the last seven days, we have seen 191 sales.** Overall, our market is looking very good for the next twelve to eighteen months. If you have any more questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us!
