*"Iâ€™m really happy with them! I called about a listing and got set up with Krista. I told her what I wanted and by the next days she had listings for me to see and by the end of the week she was looking at them for me.  She is absolutely fantastic! I was buying from out east and I had a low budget but they made me feel like I was getting the same level of service as if I had a million bucks."*
