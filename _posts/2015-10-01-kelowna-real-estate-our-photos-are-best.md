Today we are back to answer another great question. The one we have been hearing a lot lately is: **“Is it important to use professional photography when selling my home?”**

Back in 2008, we were one of the first around to use professional photography with our listings, and our trial and error through the years has allowed us to really perfect our process. What we found was that initially, the photos made a big splash and these beautiful photographs would allow our listings to get a lot of activity. However, **we also found that the homes were not selling as fast.**

This was because **the photos were so good and so appealing that the actual properties were a bit of an oversell**, which caused a letdown for buyers when they got there. **We have learned from that mistake and have gotten much better with our photos since.**

**It’s still important that all of our homes have photographs with high resolution,** that are framed properly, and capture the right light, but are not oversold or doctored too much. **You will still see agents out there using these very fancy looking photos,** and they are always too good to be true.

It's hard to get someone interested in a home when the first feeling they have upon arriving at the front door is disappointment. **You want your photos to be appealing, but representative of the property.**

If you have any questions for us about photography, or about anything else real estate related, give us a call or send us an email. We use the best photographers in the business, and would be happy to share our knowledge and experience with you.
