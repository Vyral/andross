**The media is going nuts about what is happening in our local real estate market.** You've probably heard many different things, but today I want to let you know that our market is very strong. Here are a few reasons why:

I've taken a graphic from Secrets of the Canadian Real Estate Cycle and what you will see is Kelowna becoming the number 2 job market in Canada. **When more jobs are available, more people come to town, and when more people come to town, they buy and sell more homes.**

Typically, people will rent to start out, and that is why we have 0 vacancies available. Rent prices are rising, by as much as 20%, so this will force people to buy homes.

**Demand has been increasing, and we have very little inventory available.** This means that prices are going to be rising. Last year, we saw an 8% increase in home values. However, I believe in 2016 we could see as much as an 8-10% increase in home values.

That means that 2016 could be a record-setting year in real estate!

If you've been looking to buy or sell, please don't hesitate to contact me.
