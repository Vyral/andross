At Vantage West here in Kelowna, BC, we have **8 outside agents, 2 inside sales agents and 5 support staff.** Our total sales volume lies in the $120-$150 million range, and we expect to do roughly 300 transactions this year, or at least that's the goal. Average sales price in the area is $420,000.



Also, a majority of the business that we get comes from the online marketing that we invest in. **We have multiple systems and strategies to generate leads (anywhere from 500-600 leads per month).** We also get our leads from referrals and walk-in clients.

Some of the things I'd like to harp on during the Mastermind group is how we have **refined our hiring process **here at Vantage West. We've really reversed our recruiting process to find better talent. We do an **event-style process once a quarter** where 20-30 individuals show up and from there we can pick the most qualified candidate possible.

Also, **the systems that we employ here allow our team members to be successful in what they do**. Our director of operations used to be on a real estate board that did over **600 transactions per year**, and with that kind of volume you really need good systems in place. Our director brought a lot of those same systems when we hired him here, and they're worth speaking to me about.

I look forward to meeting you all. I think there are a lot of great individuals in this group and we all have a great opportunity to learn from each other. I hope I can bring some value to the table as well.

See you in Napa!
