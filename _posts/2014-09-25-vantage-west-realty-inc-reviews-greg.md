*"Our home sold in 2 days and never even made it to the listings. Vantage West Realty typically has a good pool of clients that are looking for houses and he had 2 clients walk through and the second ended up buying it. It was so quick! They had a stager come through and give me tips to get it showable and market ready so I was very happy about that!"*
