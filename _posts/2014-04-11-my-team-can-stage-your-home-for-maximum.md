Today I am going to be talking about your return on investment and  what that will mean for you. You might have heard me talking about  holding a property for extra cash flow, but what I will be focusing on  is how you can get the largest return on your biggest investment, which  is your primary residence.

So, if you're thinking about selling, **you owe it to yourself to have us over to your home well in advance of your  sale to talk about how we can prepare your property in order to get the  highest possible sale price.**

We will go through your property room-by-room and give you tips on how to stage each and every room.<span style="font-family: inherit;"> <span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 21.559999465942383px;">**If you spend $5,000 in the right places, you can get an extra $15,000 dollars on the sale of your property** - that's the type of ROI you're going to want to see! So before you  pick up a paint brush or call a contractor, have us over so you don't  spend any unnecessary time or money.

**Buyer trends are always changing**, so you should always  ask us what would appeal to the most buyers and what would also give you  the biggest return for your money. **We can help you pick out the right paint color, good tiling, and attractive flooring for your home.**

**We have a stager that will come to your home and give you a list of things to do to market your home better**. For things that are out of your DIY range, we have a **great contractor** to refer to you for quality repairs at a good price.

So, if you want to put your home on the market here in Kelowna, be sure to give me a call because **I can form a strategy that will allow your home to look great and also get you top dollar on your property.**

Please consider sitting down with us and discussing how we can  make this happen. Also, if you are looking to buy or sell in Kelowna, give us a call because we are more than willing to help you out.
