Hey everyone, thanks for joining us again today. **We are back today answering some of the latest questions we have been getting from our clients. **

**"What should go in a rental suite to ensure I get a great tenant?"**

The number one thing I would say is to make sure it has a bathtub and dishwasher. I would also put in vinyl flooring. It looks just like laminate, but is much easier and cheaper to install.

**"When flipping a property, what else is important besides kitchens and bathrooms?"**

Aside from kitchens and bathrooms, the first thing you want to do is **change the flooring, paint, baseboards and trim throughout your home.** These are the repairs that will give you the most bang for your buck. Also, spending a little bit of money outside to brighten up your curb appeal helps you draw a much higher sale price.

**"Where are all the deals?"**

This is a common question coming from a lot of our clients right now, but the simple fact is any listing can be a deal. Just because it's not listed as a deal now, doesn't mean that there aren't deals to be had. We negotiate deals after homes are listed. A deal is what we negotiate it to be. **If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to speaking with you!**
