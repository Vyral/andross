*"We were working with Jeff from Vantage West Realty and I thought that the whole experience was very good. We had heard about him because he sold a house to my son and then he came to us with a deal. We decided to go for it and ended up taking the bid out of 7 so we got great results. He represented us through the situation and he really followed up with things that I needed to know about the purchase. Even after the deal, weâ€™re going to grab lunch next week which I think is pretty cool!"*
