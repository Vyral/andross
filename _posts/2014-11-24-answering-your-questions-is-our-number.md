At Vantage West, we take your questions and concerns very seriously. Today, we're going to continue answering some of the questions you have sent in:

**Rob asks: Where are the buyers coming from right now?**
Right now, 50% of all the transactions that take place are happening from people inside of our borders, locals moving from one property to another. The next big chunk of the market is Albertans, who represent about 25% of the sales. The next big chunk is the Northern British Columbia component - these are our resource workers who can live anywhere, but choose to live here because of the direct flights up to Fort McMurry. The other 10% to 15% of buyers are spread out between people from all over Canada, as well as international movers.

**Randy asks: How can I increase my chances of getting multiple offers when selling my home? If I'm successful, how can I give myself enough time to review all the offers?**
It's very common to see multiple offer situations in our current market. What we're doing to give that a higher chance of happening is setting a perfect price from the start. Then, we wait about a week before hitting the MLS to get pent-up demand for the property. We get really good pictures and staging before waiting to show it. Once the weekend hits, we use it as the first opportunity to show the home. Once we have that pent-up demand and people are starting to talk about making an offer, we let everyone know that we're not accepting offers until Monday night. This strategy creates an auction effect, making sure everyone has a chance to get an offer in and, usually, pushing the sales price above the original asking price.

**Dan asks: Where do I find a complete list of distressed properties?**
Going back to 2009 through 2011, there was a huge list of distressed properties, often with 150 or more homes for sale. That list has shrunk to about a third of that size, but we still have a great list of foreclosures, distressed sales, estate sales, and other great deals. If you would like a copy of that list, we could set you up to get automatically notified each time a new distressed property hits the market. If that's something you're interested in, just drop us a line - we would be happy to set you up on that.

If you need anything or have any other questions, keep them coming. I'm going to keep answering them here on our video blog, so you can make informed decisions in our marketplace. Thanks for the great questions, and let us know what we can do to help you maximize your real estate experience!
