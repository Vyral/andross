*"When we walked in we expected to go in and try to do a rent-to-own program but they were able to find us a mortgage broker that was able to help us get a mortgage. They look at our numbers and talked with us about our options and they were just helpful from step 1. I was in Mexico the final week before closing and he really made sure that I had everything done before I left and organized all my paperwork for me while I was out of county. He was always there for us!"*
