If you've ever been a client of mine, you know how absolutely important I  think it is to price your home correctly right out of the gate. I'm  going to go over a few different reasons why I think this is absolutely  critical for getting a high sale price on your home.<span style="font-size: medium;">

> 1. **The Quicker You Sell, the More $$$ You Get:** The  first two weeks that your home is on the market are by far the most  critical period for getting top dollar. Some realtors will tell you that  for every day your property is on the market after these two weeks, you  could be losing money on your home every day. Buyers will see that your  home has not sold, and begin to wonder why. This will cause them to  question the value of your home.
1. **Buyers Shop for Best Value:** Buyers will shop around to find  the best value for a home, just like they will for any other commodity.  If you price your home too high, then you will be aiding the other more  attractively priced homes to sell. Don't sell other peoples' homes!
1. **Appraisals Can Hurt You:** If a buyer likes your home and then  has a bank do an appraisal and the appraiser finds your home's value  lower than what you're selling it for, then that can be a major problem.  What I recommend you to do is to have an appraisal done prior to  listing your home. There are three reasons why you should do this:
  * **It's a Marketing Tool:** If you list your home lower  than what the appraisal value is, then buyers will know they are getting  a great deal and they will swarm to your property.
  * **It's a Negotiating Tool:** Having an appraisal to refer to during the closing period will help to protect your equity.
  * **An Insurance Policy:** Getting your own appraisal done will  ensure that your home does not run into any problems when a buyer has a  bank do an appraisal on the property. You can reference your own  appraisal and defend your asking price without question.

Ultimately the decision of where to price your home is up  to you. My job as a realtor is to facilitate the market. Thanks to  technology, I can do it better than ever before.** I can track the market's response to your listed property in real-time**,  and this allows me to see how many realtors sent the listing to  clients, and how many of those clients responded positively to the  listing. This allows me to stay way ahead of the ballgame and I can make  any adjustments necessary to prevent your listing from going stale.

**I just want everyone to know that they should not be  adopting the old school method of asking a high price and then going  lower until offers are made. As we know, the longer you are on the  market, the weaker your negotiating position is.**
